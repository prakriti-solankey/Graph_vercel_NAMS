 * The check that separates memory from conversation history: a fact stated in
 * one session has to survive into a different session. `t.newSession()` starts
 * a fresh transcript, so anything recalled afterwards came out of NAMS.
 *
 * The fact is deliberately an odd, rare word. NAMS retrieval is lexical, and a
 * workshop workspace fills up with near-identical turns ("what is my final year
 * project?") that a generic phrase competes with.
